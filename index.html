        <h1>These are some sample pages for us to use!</h1>
        <p>We need several pages so that we can explore directory structure. These pages don't necessarily make much
            sense, but will serve our purpose!
        </p>
        <p>We might like to know more about this project, so we will link to the about page here.</p>
        <p>We also might like to see some images. To make this easier, we will show them on this page...linking to them
            gets pretty complicated on the other pages!</p>
